// Package secrets wraps the age encryption primitives that keep terva's
// secret material safe to READ at rest.
//
// The threat this package answers is not a stolen disk: it is a model — the
// agent's own tools, or an outside agent pointed at $TERVA_HOME — legitimately
// reading a config file and copying its contents into a session transcript,
// where they persist forever. Encrypted material makes that read harmless, so
// files can stay inspectable instead of denied wholesale.
//
// Two shapes, one key:
//
//   - whole-file: auth.json becomes a single binary age stream (detected by
//     IsAgeFile — every age v1 stream begins with an ASCII header line).
//   - field: an individual JSON string value becomes "enc:age:v2:<base64>",
//     single-line and round-trip-safe through any load/save that treats it as
//     an opaque string.
//
// The key is an X25519 identity (the age-keygen file format). The asymmetry is
// deliberate even though encrypt and decrypt usually happen in one process:
// the RECIPIENT is not a secret, so tooling — or a model editing config — can
// mint a new encrypted value with no access to the private key.
//
// # Values are BOUND to where they live
//
// age authenticates each value, so a hostile writer cannot forge or alter one.
// What it cannot stop on its own is RELOCATION: the files holding these values
// are writable (the sandbox write jail covers the file tools only — bash walks
// past it, and /unjail lifts it), so an attacker who cannot open a value can
// still MOVE it to a path where terva will open it and hand it somewhere else.
// Point-of-use decryption is what makes that pay: move a sealed image key into
// an extension's config field and the host dutifully delivers it.
//
// So a field seals a small JSON object, {"b":binding,"v":value}, rather than
// the bare string, and DecodeField refuses when the binding does not match
// where the value was found — the AAD trick, done by hand because age's Go API
// exposes no associated-data parameter. A whole-file MAC would also close it,
// but only by requiring byte-identical canonical JSON from every language that
// may ever write a shared file, which is a far worse bargain (see §8.13 Q11 of
// the proposal). Binding costs one nested object and needs no second key.
//
// It does not close everything, deliberately: DELETING a value is a denial of
// service no crypto prevents (the declared-path schema is what detects it), and
// REPLAYING an older ciphertext at its own binding survives until
// `terva secret rotate --revoke` destroys the key that opens it.
//
// This package knows nothing about terva's homes, flags, or config; callers
// hand it a resolver (see NewCodec) and policy lives with them. See
// docs/proposals/secrets-at-rest.md.
