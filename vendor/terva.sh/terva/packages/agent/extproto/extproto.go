// spoken between terva and its extension subprocesses. Both the host
// (packages/agent/extensions) and the SDK (packages/agent/ext) marshal/
// unmarshal the same types, so changes here ripple through both.
//
// All frames are one JSON object terminated by a single LF. Object
// boundaries follow newline boundaries; no multi-line JSON.
//
// Direction conventions in this file:
//   - Type names ending in "FromExt" are sent by the extension to terva.
//   - Type names ending in "FromHost" are sent by terva to the extension.
//   - Names without a suffix are direction-neutral payloads or shared
//     value types.
//
// Every frame has a top-level Type discriminator. Optional ID is
// present on commands and on responses to commands so the sender can
// correlate; events and notifications never carry an ID.

// MaxFrameBytes is the largest single wire frame the read side accepts.
// A frame over this limit is skipped (logged), never fatal — both the
// host and the SDK read through ReadFrame, which recovers via lineframe
// instead of dying the way bufio.Scanner does on ErrTooLong.
const MaxFrameBytes = lineframe.DefaultMaxBytes

// MaxToolCallBytes caps the serialized args the host will put in one
// tool_call frame sent to an extension. Kept comfortably below
// MaxFrameBytes so the extension can always read what the host sends;
// oversized args come back to the model as a tool error instead of
// killing the extension mid-read.
const MaxToolCallBytes = 1 << 20 // 1 MiB

// ProtocolVersion is the wire revision this host/SDK speaks.
//
//	1 — baseline: tool_result fanout, crash surfacing, min-protocol
//	    negotiation.
//	2 — session identity: session_id / session_path / session_title on
//	    the session_start event, re-fired on every session switch, and
//	    a host guarantee that session_start reaches a subscriber before
//	    that session's first tool invocation (ordered delivery). An
//	    extension that needs per-session state declares RequireProtocol(2).
//	3 — refreshable context + host tool calls. refresh_context lets an
//	    extension replace its static system-prompt block at any time (not
//	    just the register phase), and the host rebuilds the cached system
//	    prompt live; the per-extension static budget is also larger (see
//	    context.go). host_tool_call lets an extension run one of the
//	    HOST's tools (read/bash/an MCP tool…) under the host's own
//	    permission gate and get the result back — the reverse of tool_call
//	    — so a code-execution extension can call host tools from a
//	    sandboxed script. list_sessions / read_session give an extension
//	    read-only, project-scoped access to past session transcripts (for
//	    a session-search index, say). An extension that needs any of these
//	    declares RequireProtocol(3). Additive: a v2 host ignores the new
//	    frames (an unanswered request simply never returns; the static
//	    block stays at its register-phase value).
//	4 — per-session tool withdrawal. set_withdrawn_tools lets an extension
//	    hide (and later restore) its OWN already-registered tools for the
//	    session, so a git extension outside a repo — or a cloud extension
//	    with no credentials — stops paying tokens and inviting misfires for
//	    tools that can only refuse. It is the tool analog of refresh_context:
//	    a wholesale withdrawn-set snapshot, host-diffed so an unchanged set
//	    costs nothing, applied at the single ext.tools enumeration so the
//	    tool drops from both the callable registry and the system prompt.
//	    NOTE: the frame is itself fire-and-forget (no blocking reply) and so
//	    by the rule below needs no bump on its own — a protocol-3 host
//	    silently ignores it and the tools simply stay visible (today's
//	    behavior). The bump exists ONLY so an extension can feature-detect
//	    (Host().ProtocolVersion >= 4) and not believe it hid tools an older
//	    host ignored. There is no RequireProtocol(4): older hosts keep
//	    loading the extension.
//	5 — connector role (experimental). register_connector declares that
//	    ONE extension process is also a chat connector, and the chat_open /
//	    chat / chat_close / chat_down envelope frames then TUNNEL the
//	    connector protocol (packages/agent/connproto) through this wire
//	    verbatim — the extension/connector unification
//	    (docs/proposals/connector-extensions.md). This protocol never
//	    mirrors connproto's vocabulary: the inner frames (hello, connect,
//	    message, send, result, …) ride opaquely inside `chat` envelopes,
//	    including connproto's own hello/hello_ack version negotiation, so
//	    connproto can grow — and renegotiate its version — without this
//	    protocol changing at all. Every envelope frame degrades gracefully
//	    on an older host (unknown frames are logged and ignored; the tools
//	    keep working — the connector role just never activates), so by the
//	    rule below the bump exists ONLY for feature detection
//	    (Host().ProtocolVersion >= 5): an extension must not sit waiting
//	    for a chat_open an older host will never send. A connector-only
//	    extension MAY RequireProtocol(5) to refuse loading where its whole
//	    purpose is unavailable.
//
// Not every new message bumps this number. A fire-and-forget event an
// extension *optionally* subscribes to — e.g. transcript_compacted, fired
// after the host compacts the transcript so a memory extension can
// re-snapshot its refreshable context — is purely additive and gracefully
// degrading: an older host records the subscription and simply never
// emits it. Such events need no version bump and no RequireProtocol. Only
// request/response features (whose caller blocks for a host answer) gate
// on the version.
//
//	6 — extension secrets. secret_set / secret_get / secret_delete /
//	    secret_list let an extension keep credentials it acquires at RUNTIME
//	    (an OAuth token it negotiated, an API key a user pasted into its own
//	    UI) without writing them to ext-data/ in the clear, where a model
//	    reading files finds them. The host seals them into its own scoped
//	    store, so unlike a connector an extension needs no key of its own —
//	    it never runs when terva does not, so a key to generate, store, back
//	    up and rotate would buy nothing. Scoping is HOST-enforced: the driver
//	    substitutes the calling extension's manifest name and the frames carry
//	    no scope to forge. These BLOCK on a reply, so an extension that needs
//	    them declares RequireProtocol(6) rather than hanging against a v5
//	    host.

// --- Host context contributions (protocol 2, additive) -----------------
//
// These let an extension contribute to what the MODEL sees, under host
// control. The host wraps, bounds, attributes, and places every
// contribution; the extension only supplies content. Two channels with
// different cache/authority profiles:
//
//   - register_context: a STATIC block folded into the cached system
//     prompt addendum (set once, during the register phase). Use it for
//     standing policy/guidance — the text that never changes.
//   - context_card / context_card_clear: a DYNAMIC, per-turn block the
//     host injects at the cache-free tail and never persists. Use it for
//     live state (e.g. a task list) updated as it changes.
//
// status_segment is the adjacent status-bar channel (host-rendered, not
// model-facing). All are additive: an older host treats them as unknown
// frames and ignores them.

// the system-prompt addendum (host-wrapped + bounded). Sent during the

// rebuilds the cached system prompt, and the change takes effect on the
// next turn. The block stays a *snapshot* — it changes only when the
// extension sends this frame, not per turn — so an extension can
// re-snapshot at a session boundary (new project → that project's notes)

// --- Connector role (protocol 5, additive, experimental) ---------------
//
// These frames let ONE extension process also be a chat connector — the

// register phase; the host REFUSES the role unless the extension's
// manifest also declares "connector": true, so an installed tool
// extension can never quietly grow into a message source.
//
// The chat session itself is NOT expressed in this protocol. When a chat
// consumer selects the extension (`terva bot run --connector <name>`, the
// TUI's /connect), the host opens a tunnel (chat_open) and the two sides
// run the CONNECTOR protocol (packages/agent/connproto) through it: each
// `chat` envelope carries one connproto frame verbatim, starting with the
// extension's hello and the host's hello_ack — so connproto's own
// negotiated versioning applies inside the tunnel, and connproto can grow
// new frames or bump its version without this protocol changing. Exactly
// one implementation of the connector wire exists on each side
// (host: packages/agent/chat/connhost; author: connsdk.Serve); this
// envelope only moves its bytes.
//
// Envelope frames carry a host-minted session ID so a close/reopen can
// never interleave: frames for a stale session are dropped by both sides.
// Sessions are serial — one live session per extension.

// RegisterConnectorFromExt declares this extension is also a chat
// connector (register phase, alongside register_tool). Refused — logged
// and ignored — when the manifest lacks "connector": true. Carries no

// restart budget, but a dual-role process must not die (or be blindly
