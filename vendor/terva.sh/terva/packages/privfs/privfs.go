// Package privfs centralizes creation of user-private terva state on disk.
//
// $TERVA_HOME holds material meant only for the invoking user: config.json
// (which stores extension secrets in plaintext), conversation transcripts,
// error sidecars, and subprocess logs. Historically terva wrote these as 0644
// files under 0755 directories, so on a multi-user or shared-home system
// another local account could read them. This package writes new state as
// 0600/0700, offers an atomic private write for config, and repairs
// pre-existing permissive state once per install.
